# Blue5 | A monospace adventure
Learning myself React while creating a simple, but hopefully challenging and enjoyable game.

## How to play
- Visit https://blue5.ontdeksels.nl to play it online
- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `5173` so you can play it on your own machine.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory, so you can deploy and play it on the webserver of your choice.

## Background information
